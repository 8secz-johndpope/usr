#  it.ini:
#      the .ini file for it-specific preferences.
#
#   Available commands:
#       SetPref name value
#       LockPref name value
#       LoadExtension type filename - type can be tcl or python
#   
#   In addition, you can use standard safe-tcl commands
#   to perform calculations and substitutions.  We also
#   provide the following procs:
#       GetDir which - returns a kwnown path, one of:
#                       installdir prefs etc lib home
#       GetEnv var   - get an environment variable
#       GetHostName  - machine's name
#       GetPref name - returns the current value of a pref.
#       GetUserName  - who am i
#       LogMsg code msg - logs a message at a level indicated
#           by code which should be one of:
#               COPIOUS, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR

# view mapping. In previous versions of "it" these were performed in 8 bit
# and were no interactive controls. They now appear on the Monitor tool bar

# Definitions of "auto" colorspace mode. When an image's color space
# is specified as "auto" this table is consulted for the actual space. Thus
# rendered floating point images can be defaulted to "linear" whereas 8 bit

# Caveat: Previous versions of 'it' referred to these related settings by
# what transformations needed to occur to the image to display correctly. 'it'
# now specifies the image space the pixels are in.
